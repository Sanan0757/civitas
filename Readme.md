# Civitas

## Overview
Civitas is a geospatial data-driven application that leverages **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **Hexagonal Architecture** to provide insights and analytics for urban environments. It integrates various geospatial services, routing functionalities, and data processing techniques to deliver valuable insights for city planning, logistics, and more.

## Preview
(It takes some time to load the map first time, but after that it will be momentary since both server side and client side cache are implemented)

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.9
- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with PostGIS
- **Geospatial Tools:** Overpass API, Terra
- **Frontend:** Mapbox GL JS
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Terraform
- **Linting:** Black

## Architecture

### Two Application Modes
Civitas can run in two different modes using a **single entry point** (`main.py`) with **command-line arguments**:

1. **Web App (`web`)**: Runs the interactive web application.
2. **ETL Process (`etl`)**: Executes the data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) pipeline.

This approach allows for **code reuse** across both modes, including shared logic, models, and configurations.


### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
Civitas follows the **Domain-Driven Design** approach, structuring the codebase into meaningful business domains. The core logic is encapsulated in domain entities, keeping the system modular and scalable.

### Hexagonal Architecture
The project implements **Hexagonal Architecture**, also known as the **Ports and Adapters Pattern**, to keep business logic independent from external dependencies such as databases or APIs. This approach allows easier testing and better maintainability.

- **Adapters**: Interfaces for interacting with external services (e.g., Overpass, Terra)
- **Application Layer**: Handles use cases and business logic
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Database and external service implementations
- **Domain Layer**: Core business rules and models

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Setup
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PatrickKvartsaniy/civitas.git
cd civitas

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

### Local Development (Web Server)
```sh
make run_web
```

### Local Development (ETL)
```sh
make run_etl
```

### Deploy to AWS
```sh
make deploy
```

### Destroy
```sh
make destroy
```

## API Documentation
Civitas provides an interactive API documentation using **Swagger**. Once the server is running, visit:

- Swagger UI: `https://civitas-471b.onrender.com/docs`

## Configuration & Environment Variables
Civitas uses a `env` for configuration. The following environment variables are required:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/civitas
MAPBOX_API_KEY=your_mapbox_api_key
OVERPASS_API_URL=https://overpass-api.de/api/interpreter
```

### Running Migrations
```sh
alembic upgrade head
```

### Run static analysis and linting:
```
Happens automaticly when commit
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
